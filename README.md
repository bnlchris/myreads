## Resources

This project is last but one project of [Udacity's Front End Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

The goal in this project was to use React. I built my application from scratch, however, I copied [Udacity's starter code](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter) in some parts, for example concerning the grid structure's CSS.

Finally, I'd like to say thank you to Maeva NAP who offered a study jam on her [Youtube site](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6L2jLHV9j8) with a lot of advice to finish this project.
